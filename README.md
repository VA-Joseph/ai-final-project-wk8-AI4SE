## 🌍 Problem Statement

Millions of primary and secondary school students in underserved regions lack access to tailored educational resources, guidance, and mentorship. Despite mobile phone penetration, many learners cannot access personalized learning due to internet limitations, device constraints, or lack of guidance. This project aims to **bridge that gap** using **AI and USSD technology**.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To build an **AI-powered USSD platform** that provides:
- **Personalized learning paths** tailored to each student’s interests, behavior, and performance.
- **Character-building insights** through behavioral tracking and positive reinforcement.
- **Guided career paths** and adaptive micro-content for life-long learning.

---

## 🧠 AI Approach

### Applied Software Engineering Concepts
- **Automation:** NLP and behavior analytics for adaptive responses.
- **Testing:** Unit & integration tests to validate decision models.
- **Scalability:** Modular microservices for AI logic, USSD routing, and user data storage.

### Technical Solution
- NLP-based **dialog manager** to guide conversations.
- Behavior scoring model to infer learning styles and traits.
- Recommendation engine for study material, character development nudges, and guidance.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Frameworks

- **AI/ML:** Scikit-learn, NLTK, Rule-based scoring engine.
- **Backend:** Python (Flask), Twilio USSD API or Africa’s Talking API.
- **Deployment:** GitHub + Render or Railway + Docker (for microservices).
- **Data Sources:** UNICEF Education Datasets, Open Education Resources (OER), behavior analysis from usage data.

## 💡 Key Features

- **Smart Guidance Engine**: Learner receives bite-sized content based on interest and behavior.
- **Behavior Mapping**: System detects procrastination, curiosity, or resistance to learning and adjusts.
- **Character Nudging**: Sends motivational or corrective nudges to improve attitudes.
- **Offline-first**: No internet required — built using **USSD and SMS** only.
- **Personalized**: Tracks learner growth and adapts to help each one **find a specialization path** early.

---

## 📊 AI Components Breakdown

- **Behavior Model:**  
  Decision tree or rule-based scoring system based on interaction patterns.

- **Content Recommender:**  
  Suggests topics based on interest clusters (e.g., STEM vs. Arts preferences).

- **Ethical Evaluation:**  
  Run fairness checks to prevent gender or location bias in content delivery.

---

## 🤖 Sample Python Snippets

### Simulate behavior-based learning path:
```python
def recommend_path(interactions):
    if interactions['curiosity'] > 7:
        return "STEM pathway – Encourage exploration in Math & Science"
    elif interactions['social'] > 7:
        return "Civic Engagement – Focus on leadership and communication"
    else:
        return "General – Reinforce foundational skills and decision-making"
```
